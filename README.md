First Voltera KiCad
===================

Here are the project files I produced when trying to create my own PCB from scratch using KiCad.

The goal was to try out the Voltera One I bought via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltera/voltera-your-circuit-board-prototyping-machine)

All turned out fine and so far all cards has worked straight out of the machine.
